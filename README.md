## Community

OpenProject is driven by an active group of open source enthusiasts: software engineers, project managers, creatives, and consultants. OpenProject is supported by companies as well as individuals. We share the vision to build great open source project collaboration software.

## Repository

This repository contains two main branches:

* `dev`: The main development branch. We try to keep it stable in the sense of all tests are passing, but we don't recommend it for production systems.
* `stable`: Contains the latest stable release that we recommend for production use. Use this if you always want the latest version of OpenProject.
